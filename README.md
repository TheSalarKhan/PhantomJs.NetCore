# Generate PDF in .NET CORE!
 This project uses PhantomJs [http://phantomjs.org] executables to generated pdf from html strings.
 This library should work on Windows, Linux and OSX, it checks for the platform on the fly and uses the appropriate executable.

# Example
  For a simple example have a look at Example.cs
  * Do not forget to include the PhantomJSRoot folder in your project. The path to this directory is required when initializing the PdfGenerator object.

# Contributions
  I made this library because There were no easy solutions for generating PDF on .NET Core especially on Linux. 
  I plan to package this into a nuget when I have time, but It would be great if anyone else could do it. 
  Any and all bug reports and Feature requests are welcome.
 
# Licenses
  Fork it, redistribute it, do whatever! Have fun!
 
 Cheers!
